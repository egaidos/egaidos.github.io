<p>Three decades ago, the only planetary system we were certain of was our own. Now we know of thousands of systems; their diversity challenges our theories of planet formation and evolution, provides required context for understanding the Solar System, and is the foundation upon which rigorous searches for habitats and life elsewhere in the Universe will be built. This course exposes students to the present state of knowledge of planetary systems using representative data at the field’s leading edge, introduce key theoretical concepts and analytic and numerical tools with broad application, and develops teamwork, presentation, and publishing skills.</p>

<p>This course was an opportunity for graduate students to learning technical and stylistic aspects of writing a manuscript for a peer-reviewed publication.  It was offerred six times in two different modes.  In the first mode, the student and instructor collaborated on a writing a review paper on a topic of mutual interest.  The four reviews, all published are:  <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2005.5.100">Beyond the Principle of Plentitude: A Review of Terrestrial Planet Habitability</a></p>
