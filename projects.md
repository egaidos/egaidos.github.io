<p><b>Temperate Planets:</b> With time, transit surveys like TESS are discovering temperate sub-Neptune-size planets near or inside the ``habitable zones" of K and M stars where water can condense as liquid cloud droplets or even oceans.  These planets offer insight into the evolution of atmospheres of smaller, rocky planets.</p>

<p><b>Evolution and Diversification of Protoplanetary Disks: </b> What governs the evolution and diversification of protoplanetary disks and what are the implications for planetary systems?  What is responsible for the differences between co-eval disks in the same cluster, and observed trends with stellar mass?  This project focuses on the role of dissipation of the outer disk driven by stellar X-rays, and the attenudation of X-rays by structures in the inner disk.</p>

<p><<b>Chimeric Disks and the Late Stages of Planet Formation:</b> This is a critical but more poorly explored phase tens or even hundreds of Myr into the evolution of planetary systems, where most of the (inner) planet-forming disk has dissipated but planet formation may not be complete and there may be a substantial reservoir of small bodies.  These can be studied via their production of or association with dust that is can be detected either in emission or occultation.  These planetesimals serve as dynamical tracers and compositional indicators for larger, unseen objets.</p>
