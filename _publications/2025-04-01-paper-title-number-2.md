In this work my colleague Tatsuya and I use a self-consistent hydrodynamic-radiative-chemical model of atmospheric outflow to show that sub-Neptunes with water vapor in their upper atmospheres can retain their envelopes against stellar radiation-driven escape.  Since the water-vapor in the atmosphere is sensitive to the planet's equilibrium temperature through the Clausius-Claperyon relation, this creates an ``oasis" for sub-Neptunes at intermediate distances and explains a puzzling feature of the demographics of kepler sub-Neptunes around M dwarfs.  It also predicts that water-poor systems like those seen around M dwarfs will host fewer sub-Neptunes relative to rocky super-Earths, in accord with available observations.
