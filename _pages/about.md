I am an astronomer, planetary scientist, and geobiologist at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa.  I am a Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences as well as Cooperating Graduate Faculty in the Department of Oceanography and the Institute for Astronomy.  I study the formation and evolution of planets around other stars (exoplanets).  I am particularly interested in Earth-size, rocky planets as astronomical objects, planetary bodies, potential analogs or counterparts to Earth in different eras in its history, and possible abodes for life.
