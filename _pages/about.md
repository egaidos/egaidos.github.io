I am an astronomer, planetary scientist, and geobiologist at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa.  I am a Professor in the <a href="https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/earthsciences/">Department of Earth Sciences</a> and Cooperating Graduate Faculty in the <a href="https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/">Department of Oceanography</a> and the <a href="https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/">Institute for Astronomy</a>.  I am also a Senior Associate at the <a href="https://astro.univie.ac.at/en/">Department of Astrophysics</a> of the University of Vienna.  I study the formation and evolution of planets around other stars (exoplanets).  I am particularly interested in Earth-size, rocky planets as astronomical objects, planetary bodies, potential analogs or counterparts to Earth in different eras in its history, and possible abodes for life.  My research is supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation.
