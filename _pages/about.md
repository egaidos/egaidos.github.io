I am an astronomer, planetary scientist, and geobiologist at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa who studies the formation and evolution of planets around other stars (exoplanets).  I am particularly interested in Earth-size, rocky planets as astronomical objects, planetary bodies, potential analogs or counterparts to Earth at different points to its history, and as possible abodes for life.
